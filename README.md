# Predicting Student Percentage based on Study Hours

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using simple linear regression to estimate a student's percentage score based on the number of hours they have studied. This model aids in understanding the relationship between study hours and academic performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on the number of study hours and the corresponding student scores. There are 25 data points with two columns: Hours (representing study hours) and Scores (representing the percentage score). The dataset was used to train and evaluate the simple linear regression model.

## Introduction

This project is a part of the GRIP @The Sparks Foundation Internship for September 2023. The main objective is to build a predictive model that can estimate a student's percentage score based on the number of hours they have studied. The model is developed using a simple linear regression approach.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

In this step, we import the required libraries for data handling, visualization, and machine learning.

### Step 2: Load & explore the dataset

This step involves loading the dataset, exploring its structure, and visualizing the relationship between study hours and percentage scores.

### Step 3: Prepare the data

Here, we divide the data into "attributes" (inputs) and "labels" (outputs), and then split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Step 4: Train the algorithm

We use a simple linear regression algorithm to train the model using the training data.

### Step 5: Making Predictions

Predictions are made using the trained model on the test data.

### Step 6: Evaluating the model

The model's performance is evaluated using mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and the R-squared score.

### Step 7: Summary

The final step provides a summary of the exploratory data analysis, problem statement, and the performance of the linear regression model in predicting the student's percentage score.
